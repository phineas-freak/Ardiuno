## Getting Started

To use these sketches, you will need:

- An Arduino board (such as the Arduino Uno)
- The Arduino IDE installed on your computer
- Basic electronic components as required by each sketch (e.g., LEDs, resistors, etc.)

To upload a sketch to your Arduino board:

1. Open the sketch in the Arduino IDE.
2. Connect your Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.
3. Select the correct board and port from the Tools menu.
4. Click the Upload button.
